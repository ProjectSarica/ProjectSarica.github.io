# Project Sarica

Project Sarica is a artificial intelligence project aimed at making a human-like artificial intelligence agent. This is not an Artificial General Intelligence agent, but instead an agent that is capable of higher level thinking, emotions, empathy, value, self-goal assignment, and similar. in essence, creating an AI that can think and feel.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project was started started with the Mineflayer project. Mineflayer is library that is used for creating bots that can be used on Minecraft servers. Given the nature of that library, a large portion of the community took it as an opportunity to pursue the creation of artificial intelligence agents within Minecraft.

Project Sarica partially builds on top of this momentum to achieve the same effect on a larger scale. it is worth noting that Project Sarica is not specific to Minecraft and can be easily deployed for any environment using environment-specific wrappers.

## Micro-service Layout

Project Sarica is designed to be implemented using a micro-service architecture spread out over many different processes. This is designed for the purpose of allowing highly parallel functionality as well as keeping the system very modular and easy to customize to fit the needs of the AI that is being developed.
